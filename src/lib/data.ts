    title: 'Data-Driven Decision Making In Modern Enterprises', // Updated to match image
    content: 'Silver cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea) fish, locally known as Omena, is an important source of dietary proteins for low-income households in Kenya. The fish is characterized by high postharvest losses chiefly due to improper drying techniques, low-value addition, and poor marketing or distribution channels. The high postharvest loss has implications for the food security and livelihoods of the fisherfolk. Thus, there is a need for studies to provide crucial insights into the current postharvest practices and associated challenges faced by fish value chain actors in Kenya.\n\nA baseline study was conducted on four Omena landing beaches of Kenya\'s Lake Victoria as part of an EU-funded project. The objective of the baseline study was to assess the status of value addition and marketing of silver cyprinid. The findings of the study highlight the need for improved drying, storage, and processing techniques to enhance the quality and marketability of Omena. It also underscores the importance of capacity building, market linkages, quality assurance, and policy support to transform the Omena value chain. By addressing these challenges through innovative technologies and practices, the sector can significantly contribute to food security, livelihoods, and economic growth in the riparian communities of Lake Victoria.',

    content: 'This paper explores the multifaceted impact of social media platforms on contemporary political discourse. It examines how platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have reshaped political campaigning, citizen engagement, and the spread of information (and misinformation). The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining content analysis of social media data with surveys and interviews of political actors and citizens. Findings indicate that while social media offers unprecedented opportunities for direct communication and mobilization, it also contributes to political polarization, the proliferation of "echo chambers," and challenges to traditional media gatekeepers. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications and recommendations for fostering a healthier online political environment.',

    title: 'The Role of Precedent in Judicial Decision-Making',
    content: 'The doctrine of stare decisis, or adherence to precedent, is a cornerstone of common law legal systems. This article examines the theoretical underpinnings and practical application of precedent in judicial decision-making. It analyzes how judges interpret and apply past rulings, the circumstances under which they may deviate from precedent, and the impact of evolving social norms on established legal principles. Drawing on a comparative analysis of case law from various jurisdictions, the paper argues that while precedent provides stability and predictability, its application is a dynamic process that allows for legal evolution. The study also considers the challenges posed by novel legal questions and the increasing complexity of modern litigation.',

    title: 'Stored Products And Postharvest Research',
    content: 'Silver cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea) fish, locally known as Omena, is an important source of dietary proteins for low-income households in Kenya. The fish is characterized by high postharvest losses chiefly due to improper drying techniques, low-value addition, and poor marketing or distribution channels. The high postharvest losses are mainly due to insect infestation, fragmentation, contamination by foreign matter such as sand, stones and animal droppings. This study aimed at determining the effect of improved postharvest handling practices on the quality and shelf life of Omena. The improved practices included use of raised drying racks, sorting, washing, salting and packaging in UV-treated polythene bags. The results showed that Omena dried on raised racks had significantly lower microbial counts compared to that dried on the ground. Salting significantly reduced microbial growth and extended the shelf life of Omena. Packaging in UV-treated polythene bags further extended the shelf life by preventing re-infestation by insects and reducing moisture uptake. It was concluded that improved postharvest handling practices significantly improve the quality and extend the shelf life of Omena.',
